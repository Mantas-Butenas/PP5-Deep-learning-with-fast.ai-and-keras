## Introduction

Energy efficiency is an important aspect of building design and construction. Predicting the energy efficiency of buildings can help architects, engineers, and policymakers make informed decisions to improve energy conservation and reduce environmental impact. This project explores machine learning techniques to predict the energy efficiency of buildings based on their characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various features related to building design and construction, such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution. The target variables are heating load and cooling load, representing the heating and cooling demands of the buildings, respectively.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, you'll need Python and the following dependencies:

- Pandas
- NumPy
